# Aristo Theme for jQuery UI

Finally, a theme for jQuery UI that doesn't suck

## Demo

## Known Issues:
* Phantom orange highlights - the theme was built on top of ui-lightness, so a lot of the styles have just been left as is. You may seem the odd grey or orange highlight here and there.
* Missing components - I havenâ€™t done the vertical sliders, the progress bar and the icon classes as they are not high priority/use.
* Hard pixel values - default jQuery UI themes are built with lots of EM units, but I have replaced some of these with pixel values. Save your breath!
